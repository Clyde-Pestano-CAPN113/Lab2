        <p><h3>hurricanes are powerful weather events that work by using the warm ocean water and moist, humid air. when the warm air is flowing upward at a zone with low pressure over warm ocean water, the water is released from the air creating the clouds for the strom. as it rises the air also roatates.</H3></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Wind blows across warm ocean water</li>
        <li>the warm moist air rises</li>
        <li>as it goes up the air cools and is condensesd into large strom clouds.</li>
        <li>The cooling releases a lot of heat</li>
        <li>The heat transfer creates very strong winds</li>
